## Assignment Overview
_Java_ classes are the building blocks of Java programs. They are used to define the data and behavior of objects. Classes are needed in Java because they provide a way to encapsulate data and behavior, which makes programs more modular, reusable, and maintainable.

Here are some of the specific reasons why Java classes are needed:

- To define the data and behavior of objects: A class defines the data that an object can hold, as well as the methods that an object can perform. This allows us to create objects that have specific properties and can perform specific actions.
- To improve modularity: Classes can be grouped into packages, which makes it easier to organize and manage code. This also makes it easier to reuse code, as we can simply import the classes that we need from a package.
- To improve reusability: Classes can be reused in multiple programs. This saves time and effort, as we don't have to rewrite the same code over and over again.
- To improve maintainability: Classes make it easier to maintain programs, as changes to a class can be made without affecting other parts of the program.

In short, Java classes are essential for writing well-organized, reusable, and maintainable Java programs.
